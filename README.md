This repository is currently being developed.

As files for the data sets being used are too large to host on Github, they can be downloaded at the links below.
### Main data set: 
https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html
### Secondary data set (LLDOS 2.0.2 - Scenario Two):
https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/datasets/2000-darpa-intrusion-detection-scenario-specific-datasets

This started as a research project of investigating whether Robust PCA can be used to improve the performance of neural networks. Currently, it is being developed to become a Python package for further application.
